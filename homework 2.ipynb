In recent years, the topic of Big Data has been a term that has floated around and widely used, but it's difficult nonetheless to perfectly pinpoint what that actually means. To me, data science is a synthesis of a variety of topics, and draws from aspects of various academic fields. What comes to mind would be statistics, computer science, mathematics, and all drawing from the real world and technology universe. \\n\\nHaving been in the class for a week, and hearing the introduction from Professor Stark as well, data science as well incorporates the scientific world, and has ties to academic and publications and research, in addition to it being a profession in industry. Data science, also from a perspective of someone looking internships and work experience, relates to analytics and analysis - the analysis of data and data sets. \\n\\nThe notion of open, collaborative data science takes this one step further, and is an even newer concept. Based on what I know and my understanding of the course and teamwork, I foresee the benefits of open, collaborative data science to be it being the foundation and platform and environment in which participants (who could be students, professors, the outside community, researchers, academics, professionals) engage in a dynamic discussion together. Open, collaborative data science would be a forum allowing the sharing of knowledge, and for ideas to be built upon each other and expanded. I think within our class, the students come from such a diverse range of experiences, and that notion of teamwork in the article, is really beneficial to progress in this field of data science. \\n\\nI think the term project of publishing a paper on earthquake prediction is extremely ambitious as commented on the first day of class, but I think it'll teach us a lot about open, collaborative data science. I'm very interested in learning about the tools and resources that'll help us learn about data science, and look forward to better applying these skills towards real-life data sets and problems. Already the class is problem-solving all the time, and that must be what data science and open, collaborative data science is about!\",\n",
        " 'Benefits:\\n-Can have an open environment to allow people from all over the world to interact with each other. \\n-Collaborative work will become much more easier, especially when data is massive.\\n\\nDrawbacks:\\n-we may worry about the security of open source data transaction. Ensuring the security is an important aspect in collaboration.\\n- We also need to ensure the data accuracy, to make sure the data are transacted accurately.\\n',\n",
        " 'I think that collaborative data science is beneficial because it allows scientists to build on top of other data instead of having to retrace steps.  I think a drawback would be that without checking the collection of data, it could become less accurate and that there are still different ways to interpret the same data.',\n",
        " 'It will allow scientists to build on top of other scientists. However, if the original scientist had bugs in his code, they might not be discovered before enough people have used it.',\n",
        " 'There are three major benefits to open data science and these benefits can be distilled into 3 words: scale, innovation, and transparency. Firstly, with open data science all aspects of its process from data gathering to analysis become available for the worlds best and brightest to contribute to. An easy example of this is the Netflix Prize Netflix created to optimize their recommendation algorithm which beat the Netflix data scientists by over 10%. Secondly with open data science and open source projects more broadly we (as a humanity), in my opinion, maximize our chances for innovation in all fields and industries. If epiphany occurs once every billion \"attempts\", why allow for the billions to try? Thirdly and most importantly open data science is the greatest deterrent to misleading papers and overall faulty research. It forces transparency at the highest level. There are also several drawbacks to open data science. Firstly open data science creates obvious privacy issues and plagiaristic potentiality. It could very well be that the very fact that people need to be credited for their achievements either through fame or money that open data science never realizes its true potential. Secondly I also do believe that in terms of collaboration being good, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Conceptually if collaboration and successful projects were put on the x and y axis respectfully I see it as an inverse parabola, where too much collaboration leads to inefficiencies, confusion, and ultimately less successful projects.',\n",
        " \"Still don't have an idea about where we are going. \",\n",
        " 'Benefits - faster data distribution; can more easily try to reproduce results if the data is available\\n\\nDrawbacks - science is very competitive, and people may be unwilling to share their experiment ideas and results with a community notorious for stealing and taking the credit of others',\n",
        " 'Benefits: Being able to utilize the online community as a valued resource and sharing reproducible procedures that makes everything more streamlined.\\n\\nDrawbacks: Exposure to those who intend to cause damage through \"trolling\" and hacking. Theft of original ideas.',\n",
        " \"This topic is very new to me. \\nI expect to run into many roadblocks since I do not have as much understanding in recent programming. I like how the class forms small groups to do collaborative work and look forward to learn more after the whole setups are complete. (I'm still struggling with my computer)\",\n",

        " 'benefits:\\nPeople can share their data, which will make the data set much bigger and reliable. It will be much easier for people to work together on the same project remotely. People can share their ideas and work on different parts at the same time. Due to the above reasons, collaborative data science will help researches to progress faster.\\ndrawbacks:\\nIf everything is public, people can steal the data or the partial results without crediting the original author. Also, since a lot of people can contribute to the same project, Version control is a big issue. Data loss or system break-down will cause more serious issues.',\n",
        " 'Benefits: easy access to information, provide to channel to solve possible issues one may have, serve as a platform for people who share common interest\\n\\nDrawbacks: easy target for abuse, questionable creditability for the provided information',\n",

        " 'As of now the open aspect of this class has made it very vague. Instructions, directions, and the stuff we have been doing are quite vague. The collaborative part is where I see the benefits from. For one if someone falls behind others can easily help that person get back up to speed. Also learning in an environment where some people are weaker and some people are stronger definitely helps. For this class its easy to see that not everyone starts off at the same level of knowledge. IE some people are familiar with Python, while others',\n",
        " 'Benefits include being able to work as a team towards a single goal. As long as all the steps are reproduceable then future academics can also see if your method was valid or if your findings are not. Drawbacks to this are that there is a large initial investment. Everyone needs to be on the same page, set up with the same tools. This has its problems and takes a long time.',\n",

        " 'I think the benefits include that it facilitate sharing knowledge and ideas and building close connection, but there are concerns about privacy and data security. ',\n",
        " 'Collaborative data science can foster cooperation between groups of people that would allow a project to be completed more efficiently than it would be done in pieces, however, its efficacy depends on everyone doing their part, and a weak link in the group can stifle progress in the project.',\n",
        " 'The benefits are that people can have better share information with one another and can therefore better learn from each other. A drawback can be that the value attached with originating a particular idea is decreased. This can in turn decrease profits. ',\n",

        " 'The benefits of open, collaborative data science would be help and cooperation from a broad and enormous pool of smart and intellectual experts. This helps learning students to get help regardless of time availability of individuals and limitation of resources. This open and collaborative data science also can result greater deal of creativity to the work. Drawbacks that I can think of is that since there are such a flexibility in the participation, wrong information can easily be spread.']"
